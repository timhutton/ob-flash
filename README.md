A 2D world of bouncing atoms is directed by adding simple reactions, such as:
` a3+b7 -> a4b4`

With the right reactions you can create replicating molecules and evolution.

ob-flash is still at a very early stage. There's a moving prototype [here](http://ob-flash.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index.html) but that's about it.

Class documentation is [here](http://ob-flash.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/index.html), auto-generated by asdoc.

You can browse the source code [here](http://code.google.com/p/ob-flash/source/browse/trunk) in the svn repository.
